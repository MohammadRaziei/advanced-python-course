    "## 🎯 What Are Design Patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design patterns** are **reusable solutions** to **common problems** in software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are **not code templates**, but rather **conceptual blueprints** — proven ways to solve problems in architecture, object-oriented design, and software structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think of them as the \"best practices\" of software engineering, formalized into clear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🧱 Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like **architects** reuse structural patterns (e.g. arches, columns, bridges),  \n",
    "**software developers** reuse design patterns to build systems that are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easier to understand\n",
    "- Easier to extend\n",
    "- Easier to maintain\n",
    "- More scalable and robust\n",

    "## 💡 Design Patterns are About **Design Thinking**\n",
    "\n",
    "They answer questions like:\n",
    "- How should I manage object creation?  \n",
    "- How do I reduce tight coupling between components?  \n",
    "- How can I reuse behavior across unrelated parts of the system?\n",

    "- **Creational** (object creation)\n",
    "- **Structural** (object relationships)\n",
    "- **Behavioral** (object interaction)\n",
